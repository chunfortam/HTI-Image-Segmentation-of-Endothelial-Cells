Endothelial cells (ECs) are central to vascular health, and understanding their
metabolic processes is crucial for studying a variety of diseases, including car-
diovascular diseases (CVD), cancer, and metabolic disorders. The ability to
quantify EC metabolism, particularly mitochondrial function, is essential for as-
sessing cellular bioenergetics and understanding how these processes contribute
to disease. Traditional biochemical methods, such as detecting reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS) and measuring mitochondrial membrane potential, provide
valuable insights, but they often fail to capture real-time, dynamic changes in
1
living cells. Fluorescence-based microscopy techniques, including wide-field and
confocal microscopy, are commonly used to study ECs. However, these methods
are limited by the need for specific dye labeling, which can introduce artifacts
and obscure the natural cellular environment. Moreover, traditional microscopy
techniques do not offer the real-time, label-free imaging capabilities necessary
for observing dynamic mitochondrial changes. Holo-tomographic imaging (HTI)
has emerged as a powerful, label-free technique for imaging ECs and their sub-
cellular components. HTI utilizes light scattering principles to generate three-
dimensional refractive index (RI) tomograms of microscopic samples, providing
high-resolution, quantitative imaging without the need for fluorescent labels.
This enables the study of living ECs and their mitochondria in their natural
state, allowing for a deeper understanding of mitochondrial function and cel-
lular metabolism over time. Alongside advances in imaging technology, deep
learning methods, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have
shown significant promise in automating and improving medical image segmen-
tation. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which work together
to produce high-quality segmentations. In this study, convolutional neural net-
works (CNNs) are used for both the generator and discriminator. The gen-
erator is based on the UNet architecture, with a pre-trained ResNet50 model
acting as the encoder to capture hierarchical spatial features. Additionally,
newer segmentation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and En-
hanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) provide
exciting opportunities for improving segmentation results. SAM offers strong
adaptability across various imaging modalities, while ESRGAN enhances image
resolution, a crucial factor in high-precision tasks such as EC segmentation.
This research, in collaboration with Dr. Patrick Jurney from the Department
of Biology, aims to apply these advanced deep-learning techniques to segment
endothelial cells in HTI images. By training and evaluating models on 145 pre-
labeled HTI images, the project seeks to explore how GAN-based segmentation,
combined with SAM and ESRGAN, can improve the accuracy and reliability of
EC analysis.
